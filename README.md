# Elevation-based Navigation
EleNa (Elevation-based Navigation) is a routing software that calculates routes based on your preference of route elevation. Let’s say you are hiking or biking from one location to another. You may want to literally go the extra mile if that saves you a couple thousand feet in elevation gain. Likewise, you may want to maximize elevation gain if you are looking for an intense yet time-constrained workout.  

The high-level goal of this project is to develop a software system that determines, given a start and an end location, a route that maximizes or minimizes elevation gain, while limiting the total distance between the two locations to x% of the shortest path.
